# Design Document

## Overview

**Sabzzi** (vegetables in Hindi) is a personal grocery tracker web application designed for mobile-first usage. The app helps track grocery purchases and logs, with two distinct user roles: Buyer and Logger. Any user can act as either a Buyer or Logger depending on their activity.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js web application with Shadcn UI library
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Deployment Model**: Progressive Web App (PWA) - users will install via Chrome's "Add to Home Screen" feature
- **Platform**: Mobile-first responsive web app

## Key Components

### User Roles
1. **Buyer**: Users who purchase groceries
2. **Logger**: Users who log/record grocery items

Note: Any user can perform both roles - the role is activity-based, not permission-based.

### Core Screens
- Login Screen (entry point)
  - Register Passkey button
  - Login with Passkey button
- Home Screen (after authentication)
  - Two main tabs/sections:
    - **My Lists**: Lists created by the user
    - **To Buy**: Lists shared with the user by others
  - Settings icon in header
- My Lists Screen
  - Display all lists created by user
  - Actions: Create New List, Duplicate List, Edit List
- To Buy Screen
  - Display all lists shared with the user
  - Shows as todo-style checklist
  - Mark items as bought
- Create/Edit List Screen
  - Auto-generated list name based on date (e.g., "12 OCT LIST", "12 OCT LIST#2")
  - Optional: Set list emoji/icon
  - Add items: search existing OR create new custom items
  - Bilingual support: Add Hindi/Marathi names for items
  - Set quantity for each item (weight/money/count)
  - Save list
  - Share list with other users
- List Detail Screen
  - View all items in list with bilingual names
  - Mark items as bought (buyer role)
  - Edit/remove items (logger role)
  - Share button to share with other users
  - Comments section for collaboration
- Settings Screen
  - User profile information
  - Haptic feedback toggle
  - Logout button

### Authentication Flow

**Registration Flow:**
1. User clicks "Register Passkey"
2. System prompts for dev pin (validation pin: 4452)
3. After valid pin, initiate passkey registration (WebAuthn)
4. After successful passkey creation, ask for user's name
5. Generate and assign userId
6. Store user data in MongoDB

**Login Flow:**
1. User clicks "Login with Passkey"
2. System initiates passkey authentication (WebAuthn)
3. On success, redirect to Home screen (default: My Lists tab)

### User Experience Flow

**Creating a New List:**
1. User logs in and lands on Home screen with "My Lists" tab active
2. User sees all past lists with options to: Create New, Duplicate, Edit
3. User clicks "Create New List"
4. System auto-generates list name based on date (e.g., "12 OCT LIST")
   - If another list exists with same date, appends "#2", "#3", etc.
5. User can optionally set a list emoji/icon
6. User adds items by:
   - **Option A**: Searching/selecting existing items (e.g., "Mango", "Wheat", "Napkins")
   - **Option B**: Creating new custom items on-the-fly
7. For each item, user selects quantity type and amount:
   - **Weight-based**: 1kg, 2kg, 1/2kg, 250gms, etc.
   - **Money-based**: 20rs, 100rs, etc.
   - **Count-based**: 1 item, 10 items, etc.
8. User saves the list
9. List appears in "My Lists" tab

**Creating Custom Items:**
1. While building a list, user types item name not found in search
2. System prompts: "Create new item: [Name]?"
3. User fills in item details:
   - Item name in English (required)
   - Item name in Hindi (optional)
   - Item name in Marathi (optional)
4. User selects quantity type (weight/money/count)
5. User sets default quantities for this item
6. Item is created and added to both global items collection and current list

**Sharing a List:**
1. User opens a list from "My Lists" or clicks share button
2. System shows list of all registered users (by name)
3. User selects one or multiple users to share with
4. User can also share with themselves
5. Shared users see the list in their "To Buy" tab

**Using the "To Buy" Tab:**
1. User switches to "To Buy" tab on home screen
2. User sees all lists shared with them by others
3. Lists display like a todo checklist
4. User checks off items as they buy them
5. Original list owner sees updates in real-time

**Using an Existing List:**
1. User opens a list from "My Lists" or "To Buy"
2. Logger can add/edit/remove items
3. Buyer can mark items as "bought"
4. Both users see real-time updates

**Duplicating a List:**
1. User selects a past list
2. Clicks "Duplicate"
3. System creates a copy with all items (unmarked as bought)
4. New date-based name is auto-generated
5. User can edit before saving

**Commenting on a List:**
1. User opens a list (from "My Lists" or "To Buy")
2. Below items, user sees comments section
3. User can view all comments from collaborators
4. User can add new comment by tapping comment input
5. Comments show user name and timestamp
6. Users can delete their own comments

## Technical Decisions

1. **MongoDB**: Chosen as the database for flexible schema and scalability
   - Database "auth": Authentication data
   - Database "sabzzi": Application data (users, items, lists)
2. **Shadcn UI**: Pre-installed UI component library for consistent design
3. **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and API routes
4. **PWA Approach**: Native-like mobile experience without app store deployment
5. **Passkey Authentication (WebAuthn)**: Passwordless authentication using device biometrics/PIN
   - More secure than traditional passwords
   - Better mobile experience
   - No password storage or management needed
6. **Dev Pin Protection**: Hardcoded pin (4452) for registration to limit access during development
7. **Three Quantity Types**: Flexible item measurement system
   - Weight-based for produce and bulk items
   - Money-based for items bought by budget
   - Count-based for discrete items
8. **Denormalized Data**: Store item names in lists collection for quick access
9. **Auto-generated List Names**: Date-based naming (e.g., "12 OCT LIST", "12 OCT LIST#2")
   - Eliminates need for users to name lists
   - Easy to identify and organize
   - Automatic numbering for multiple lists on same day
10. **On-the-fly Item Creation**: Users can create items while building lists
   - No pre-population needed
   - Flexible and user-friendly
11. **List Sharing**: Multi-user collaboration
    - Lists can be shared with multiple users
    - Shared users see lists in "To Buy" tab
    - Real-time updates across all users
12. **Emoji/Icon Support**: Visual identification for lists
    - Optional but helpful for quick recognition
13. **Bilingual Support (Hindi/Marathi)**: Items can have names in multiple languages
    - English name required
    - Hindi and Marathi names optional
    - Helps users who don't know English
    - Shows regional language below English name
14. **Comments Feature**: Collaboration via list comments
    - Users can comment on shared lists
    - View all comments from collaborators
    - Delete own comments
    - Real-time comment updates
15. **Haptic Feedback**: Native-like mobile experience
    - Vibration feedback on button taps
    - Checkbox toggles with haptic
    - User can disable in settings
    - Uses Web Vibration API
16. **Mobile-First Design Principles**:
    - Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
    - Large, thumb-friendly buttons
    - Clear visual hierarchy
    - Adequate spacing between touch elements
