# WebAuthn (Passkey) Setup Guide

This app now uses **@simplewebauthn** - the industry-standard library for WebAuthn implementation.

## What Changed

### Fixed Issues:
âœ… **No more double PIN prompt** - PIN only asked once
âœ… **Proper challenge-response flow** - Server generates and validates challenges
âœ… **Passkeys actually saved** - Credentials properly registered with device
âœ… **Reliable authentication** - Works consistently across sessions

### Technical Improvements:
- Server-side verification of registration and authentication
- Proper challenge generation and expiration (5 minutes)
- Counter tracking to prevent replay attacks
- Support for credential backup and transport info
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Environment Variables

### âœ¨ Auto-Detection (Default)
The app now **automatically detects** the correct domain when deployed on Vercel!

- **Development:** Uses `localhost` and `http://localhost:3000`
- **Production on Vercel:** Automatically uses your Vercel deployment URL

**No manual configuration needed!** ðŸŽ‰

### Manual Override (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain or override the auto-detection, you can set:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RP_ID=your-custom-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://your-custom-domain.com
```

In Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables.

This is only needed if:
- You have a custom domain
- You want to explicitly control the configuration
- Auto-detection isn't working for your setup

## Registration Flow

1. User clicks "Register with Passkey"
2. **PIN Dialog** appears â†’ User enters PIN
3. **Name Dialog** appears â†’ User enters name
4. Click "Register" â†’ Biometric prompt shows
5. User verifies with Face ID/Touch ID/PIN
6. Passkey is saved to device for `sabzzi.vercel.app`
7. User is logged in and redirected to home

## Login Flow

1. User clicks "Login with Passkey"
2. Biometric prompt shows immediately
3. User verifies with Face ID/Touch ID/PIN
4. Device provides saved passkey
5. Server verifies and logs user in

## Testing

### Test Registration:
1. Open app on mobile browser
2. Click "Register with Passkey"
3. Enter PIN: `4452`
4. Enter your name
5. Verify with biometric
6. Should redirect to home page

### Test Login:
1. Close and reopen the app
2. Click "Login with Passkey"
3. Verify with biometric
4. Should log in and redirect to home page

### Verify Passkey Was Saved:
- **iOS**: Settings â†’ Passwords â†’ Search for "sabzzi.vercel.app"
- **Android**: Settings â†’ Passwords & accounts â†’ Saved passwords
- You should see an entry for your app!

## API Endpoints

### Registration:
- `POST /api/auth/passkey/generate-registration-options` - Get challenge
- `POST /api/auth/passkey/verify-registration` - Verify and create user

### Authentication:
- `POST /api/auth/passkey/generate-authentication-options` - Get challenge
- `POST /api/auth/passkey/verify-authentication` - Verify and login

## Database Schema

### Auth Collection:
```javascript
{
  userId: "user_123...",
  name: "User Name",
  credentialId: "base64...",
  credentialIdString: "base64...",  // For lookups
  credentialPublicKey: "base64...",
  counter: 0,                       // Prevents replay attacks
  credentialDeviceType: "public-key",
  credentialBackedUp: false,
  transports: ["internal"],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  lastLoginAt: Date
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No passkey found for this device"
- Passkeys are device-specific
- User needs to register on each device
- Check Settings â†’ Passwords to verify passkey exists

### "Challenge expired or not found"
- Challenges expire after 5 minutes
- User took too long to complete registration/login
- Just try again

### "Registration verification failed"
- RP_ID or ORIGIN mismatch
- Check environment variables match your domain
- Ensure you're using HTTPS in production

### Passkey not appearing in device settings
- Old implementation might have been buggy
- Delete any existing passkeys for your domain
- Re-register with new implementation

## Migration from Old Implementation

Users with passkeys from the old implementation should:
1. Delete old passkeys from device settings
2. Register again with the new implementation
3. New passkeys will work reliably

The old `/api/auth/passkey` endpoint still exists but is not used by the new implementation.

## Security Features

âœ… Server-side challenge generation
âœ… Challenge expiration (5 minutes)
âœ… Counter-based replay attack prevention
âœ… Credential backup detection
âœ… Transport method tracking
âœ… User verification required
âœ… Platform authenticator (biometrics)
âœ… Origin and RP ID validation

## Next Steps

If you want to remove PIN protection and allow public registration:
1. Remove PIN validation from `/api/auth/passkey/generate-registration-options/route.ts` (lines 8-14)
2. Remove PIN dialog from `/app/page.tsx`
3. Show name dialog directly on "Register" click

For production with sensitive data, consider:
- Email-based account recovery
- Multi-device passkey sync (when supported)
- Security key support as backup
- Audit logging for authentication events
